for readme:

was going to use just `<li>` for the info button, but used `<button>` for accessibility reasons (the ability to tab to the button)

for the onscreen keyboard, i was using each key's `innerHTML` to determine what to do to the game board,
but for backspace innerHTML is a fontawesome icon, so it doesn't work properly.
then i found this article that seemed to fit my use case better:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes

my first implementation of the algorithm to determine the color of each letter was incorrect;
if the answer was "TREAD" and i guessed "TREAT", the second "T" would turn yellow when it should be gray.
i sketched on some paper to figure out a way to solve this problem, and with the help of
a stackoverflow post (https://stackoverflow.com/a/20817684/12317855), i was able to fix it.

i originally made the game board using a html `<table>` element, but it behaved oddly when resizing the window.
i found that changing from this to instead using `display: flex` improved responsiveness.

i ran into problems when i wanted the game to take up the rest of the screen space after the header. i searched
