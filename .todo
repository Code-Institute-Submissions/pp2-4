[ ] look into aria stuff for buttons maybe



for readme:

was going to use just `<li>` for the info button, but used `<button>` for accessibility reasons (the ability to tab to the button)

i was going to give each letter key a unique id of `key-{letter}`, but i found this article that seemed to fit my use case better:
