for readme:

was going to use just `<li>` for the info button, but used `<button>` for accessibility reasons (the ability to tab to the button)

for the onscreen keyboard, i was using each key's `innerHTML` to determine what to do to the game board,
but for backspace innerHTML is a fontawesome icon, so it doesn't work properly.
then i found this article that seemed to fit my use case better:
